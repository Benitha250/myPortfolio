# Uwase's portfolio
### Benitha Uwase
This is an portfolio web page that I created containing information about myself where you will find my skills, experiences, interests and hobbies. By taking a look on this project you will easily know who I am and all my information. I also added a contact section where someone can easily have my credentials.
### Project setup instructions
